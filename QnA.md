# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- Making sure the website is scallable. The architecture of the project should be planned before starting to code.
- App should handle errors well.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- If an invalid link is entered then a toast should popup in the homepage
- The issues should have a link icon where users can click/open the original issue

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- In addition to entering a repo link, user can search keywords on the home page and then choose the repo they desire (Like Google Search)
- Recommend repos that are most popular in Github (or searched on the website) for people to look into
- Login/Sign-out feature via Gmail/Facebook authentication so user can star favorite repositories and flag issues (perhaps they want to work on certain issues and contribute to open source) on their account

-

> Did you learn anything new?

-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
